Wing Tree
The wingTree loved watching WW1 films and always wanted to be a wingman. However, its not a man, its a tree. So it settled for the next best thing. Somehow he got ahold of some avatior goggles, and put them on his trunk because he doesnt have eyes. But it makes him look cool, so no one calls him on it. Also it bears saying that this is the guy you want to bring with you to tree parties, he can make you look SOOO good in front of the female trees.
