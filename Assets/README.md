## Abstract

This page lists the common assets being used in Monster Master

### Fonts

Special fonts I made especially for the game

### Math

Leveling curves, equations for HP/MP/EXP gain and loss; Value and effects of items etc are all stored here

### Music

Though not heavily implemented yet, the Music assets we intend to use are gathered here

### Old

Assets we used to use (like those in the abandoned Unity version of the project) but didn't have the heart to get rid of (and might want to reference later) are stored here, as are originals from Dall-e that we modified for use in the game (in case that modification was shoddy and needs to be done again).

### Sprites

2D image assets can be found here

### Legal

Unless otherwise noted the Assets in this and folders contained with this folder (and all of their directories- recursively) are under the sole ownership of Austin Bailey and unless otherwise listed are authored by him or an AI. They are for the private use in the game Monster Master and are not to be used for any other purpose unless express (written) permission is given. If you would like to use them to work on the game with me (Austin Bailey) feel free to email me at a604b997@gmail.com, I'm sure we can work something out.
