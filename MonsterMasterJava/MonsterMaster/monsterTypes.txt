That combined with the regeneration and the thorny skin make the Broncheospikesaur one of the most capable defensive monsters around.

The rainbow frog is a frog that is colored like a rainbow. It was nearly hunted to extinction by the leprechauns, but they gave up when they realized that it wasn't always sitting on a pot of gold. In fact, it never was. Poor dead rainbow Frogs... There is animosity between the Rainbow Frogs and the leprechauns to this day. Their skin is highly prized for its hallucinogenic properties, and it was nearly hunted to extinction, until it became poisonous as well.

And while you're hallucinating, there's an angry magic frog annoyed that you licked its back. Or is that the hallucination? Little known fact: it was cut out of Naruto because it was too cool for either Jyria or Naruto to learn from.
