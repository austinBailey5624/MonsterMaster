Not so the Broncheospikesaur. Its blood has developed regenerative capabilities and flows near the skin healing any minor damage. This doesn't make the Broncheospikesaur vulnerable, however, since it can near instantly regenerate any damage that penetrates its shell deep enough to strike blood. Its bleating roar is also famous for being able to enrage all opponents at once.
