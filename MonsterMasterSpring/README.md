## Abstract

This is not as much of an implementation of Monster Master as it is a collection of tools to manage Monster Master assets, and model scenarios. As Java doesn't have a great UI library (looking at you LibGDX and Java swing) these are being rewritten in the Kotlin project (MonsterMasterMobile), alongside the actual game itself.
