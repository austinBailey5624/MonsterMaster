Dawn light shines through the window, still sleepy, you close your eyes and roll. It is the roosters call a moment later that actually wakes you. Your older brother mocks you as you descend the stairs: \"If it isnt' sleeping ugly\" do you:
He easily blocks your punches and laughs - "Take it easy little grey-eyes! With a temper like yours, you'll be red for sure!"
He scoffs at your silence - "Better stand up for yourself little grey eyes, or the world will run you down."
Your father calls from downstairs "Get down here, you've slept enough already", when you return downstairs your brother mocks you further - "like they haven't gotten enough sleep"
