# MonsterMaster
## Overview
MonsterMaster is a Monster Catching RPG *cough* Pokemon Clone *cough* Developed by Austin Bailey and whoever wants to join him
## Differences from Pokemon
1. **The player matters** In Pokemon Games the user really doesnt matter at all other than as a way to move yourself around the screen. In MonsterMaster as the character you are an active participant in the battle and defeat occurs when you are knocked out, not just when the monster representing you is defeated *it also bears noting that monsters gain experience much faster than humans.
2. **There is player choice** that shapes the world around you.
3. **There isn't a single way to win the game.** There are factions that you side with and gain ranks and reputation with that determine how you play and end the game.
4. **The world is open.** Although there are gates to certain areas, (and certain areas are much more difficult than others) you can directly open them by sacrifice a monster with certain stats
5. **You can Combine monsters.** Part of the game is combining your monsters to make better monsters.
6. **Level Cap.** The level of monsters is capped based on how many monsters are in its family tree. A second generation will be more powerful and have a higher level cap than a first generation etc
7. **You don't catch monsters with pokeballs.** Instead, you try and impose your will over it and your success will be determined by your level differential and also the decisions you've made in the game - an aggressive player will be better at catching fire monsters, a passive player water monsters etc.
8. **Monster evolution isn't linear.** How you use the monster will determine how it evolves-usually. A monster that attacks physically will have a different evolution than if that same monster used only magical attacks.
9. **Monsters are Expensive** There is no infinite box to hold the monsters, keeping them costs money - higher for stronger evolutions/generations. You cant simply catch all of them, because you probably cant afford it-unless you own the world.
