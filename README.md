# MonsterMaster
## Overview
MonsterMaster is a Monster Catching RPG *cough* Pokemon Clone *cough* Developed by Austin Bailey and whoever wants to join him
## Differences from Pokemon
1. **The player matters** In Pokemon Games the user really doesnt matter at all other than as a way to move yourself around the screen. In MonsterMaster as the character you are an active participant in the battle and defeat occurs when you are knocked out, not just when the monster representing you is defeated *it also bears noting that monsters gain experience much faster than humans.
2. **There is player choice** that shapes the world around you.
3. **There isn't a single way to win the game.** There are factions that you side with and gain reputation with that determine how you play and end the game.
4. **The world is open.** Although there are gates to certain areas, (and certain areas are much more difficult than others) you can directly open them by sacrifice a monster with certain stats
5. **You can Combine monsters.** Part of the game is combining your monsters to make better monsters.
6. **Level Cap.** The level of monsters is capped based on how many monsters are in its family tree. A second generation will be more powerful and have a higher level cap than a first generation etc
7. **You don't catch monsters with pokeballs.** Instead, you try and impose your will over it and your success will be determined by your level differential and also the decisions you've made in the game - an aggressive player will be better at catching fire monsters, a passive player water monsters etc.
8. **Monster evolution isn't linear.** How you use the monster will determine how it evolves-usually. A monster that attacks physically will have a different evolution than if that same monster used only magical attacks.
9. **Monsters are Expensive** There is no infinite box to hold the monsters, keeping them costs money - higher for stronger evolutions/generations. You cant simply catch all of them, because you probably cant afford it-unless you own the world.
  
  
## Gameplay 

1. **Elements**
	*I can see your soul through your eyes* Each person, and monster has an element. Which element it is can be determined by looking at the color of their eyes. 
  * **Fire** 
    * People with a fire element are passionate and aggressive. They tend to act on instinct. They deal more damage to Air Types and take more damage from Water Types. People who are fire elemental have *red* eyes
  * **Water**
    * People with a water element tend to be passive and calm, they work things out logically before acting. Water elementals deal more damage to Fire types and take more damage from earth types. People who are water element have *blue* eyes
  * **Earth**
    * People with an earth element tend to be unwilling to embrace change, they honor tradition. They also favor logic and patience, and are introverted. They tend to be serious. They deal more damage to water elementals and take more damage from air elementals. People who are earth elemental have *green* eyes
  * **Air**
    * People with an air element tend to be ready to embrace change, and deride tradition for tradition's sake. They tend to be carefree and extroveted. Air elementals deal more damage to Earth Elementals and take more damage from fire elementals. The eyes of Air Elementals are yellow.	
  * **Light**
    * Light elementals are people who follow a cause or a set of beleifs with utmost rigor. They tend to be religious and how they act is usually based on the tenants of that religion. They deal more damage, and take more damage from Dark Elementals. They have white eyes
  * **Dark**
    * Dark elementals follow their own code and are often unpredictable. They often have a sense of right and wrong, but they don't let anyone tell them what to do. They tend to be very independent and can be good leaders but usually make terrible followers- unless they find other people with similar ideals. People who are dark elemental have *dark grey* eyes.  
	
2. **Special Elements**	
  * **Grey**
	*  Children who have yet to be exposed to the world have grey eyes. Their eyes change color during puberty.
  * **Bound**
	*  After a dramatic change happens in someones life, their element may become 'bound', in which case their old element is trapped by a new one. For instance, if a fiery barbarian is captured and converted by the church, his red eyes would be bound by an outer iris of white.

3. **Factions**
  1. **The Church Of The Divine**
	* The church of the Divine is a very large entitiy and has reached the far corners of the world. There are six factions within the church
	1. **The Just**
	  * The Just are the warrior arm of the church. They are very strict and favor justice instead of mercy. They are unforgiving and hate the redeemed, the arm of the church made up of former crimenals.
	2. **The Merciful**
      * The Merciful are the scribes of the church and travel around the world to bring the church more knowledge. They always argue for mercy under any circumstance believeing that anyone can be redeemed. Despite this, though they know some healing, they are unwilling to heal anyone they deem evil or selfish- anyone with black eyes.	
	3. **The Compassionate**
	  * The Compassionate are primarily the healers of the church and believe in the good in people. As such they are always willing to heal anyone. They are also known as **The Humble** because they see possession as sinful and so wear only the meanest threadbare robes- which are actually owned by the church.
	4. **The Missionaries**
	  * The Missionaries job is to go to other lands and spread the gospel. They intend well but often  are resented by those they help by reforming their cultural identity.
	5. **The Divine**
	  * The Divines are the leadership of the church, headed by Saint Keller, a preist who wears a veil over his eyes. They say his eyes are so brilliantly white they blind those who see them- hence the veil. Upon his death the Saint selects his successor. They also serve as bureaucrats and judges.
	6. **The Redeemed**
      * The Redeemed are former criminals who make up half of the military arm of the church. They vehemetly despise evil and wrongdoing, perhaps even more fiercely than the just. They are famous for giving their enemies a chance to repent and convert before their deaths. The just seek to destroy this faction as they dont believe in reform.
