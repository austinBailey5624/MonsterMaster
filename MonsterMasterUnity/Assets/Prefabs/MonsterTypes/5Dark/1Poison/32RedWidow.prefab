  name: Red Widow
  description: The Red Widow has gotten over her husbands death. The hourglass has
    turned black, and the rest of her has turned red. This color, and the scent given
    off from her hide, attracts insects to their doom. Her bright color does as well.
    She taunts enemies by making them think she is injured, but when they are close,
    shows them it is they that are prey.
