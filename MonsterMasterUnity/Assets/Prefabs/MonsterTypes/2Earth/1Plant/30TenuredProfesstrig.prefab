  name: Tenured Professtrig
  description: The Professtrid has tenure, thus doesn't actually have to work anymore
    and can do whatever it wants. It also has a stare that can put someone in their
    place, as long as that person is not the dean. It is amazed by its tenure, because,
    once given, the Professtrig never has to work again - but its so smart that the
    college was willing to give it that kind of resource.
