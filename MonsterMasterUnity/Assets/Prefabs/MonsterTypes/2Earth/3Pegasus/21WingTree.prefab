  name: Wing Tree
  description: The wingTree loved watching WW1 films and always wanted to be a wingman.
    However, its not a man, its a tree. So it settled for the next best thing. Somehow
    he got a hold of some aviator goggles, and put them on his trunk because he doesn't
    have eyes. But it makes him look cool, so no one calls him on it. Also it bears
    saying that this is the guy you want to bring with you to tree parties, he can
    make you look SOOO good in front of the female trees.
