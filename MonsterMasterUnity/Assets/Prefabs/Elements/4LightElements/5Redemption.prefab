  name: Redemption
  description: 'Redemption monsters are demons that have seen the error of their
    ways. Many, if not all of them, were born into darkness, and rejected it to find
    the light. They are conflicted with some of the other light elementals- some
    Justice monsters feel that they have not payed the full price for their earlier
    crimes, and some Luxor monsters refuse to heal them altogether. It is because
    of this, some think, that the redeemed can fall back into darkness, while others
    question: "what other choice did they have?". Masters of redemption monsters
    will gain their favor if they refuse to give up on someone who is fallen, and
    see the light- even in dark places.'
