  name: Betrayer
  description: These fallen angels once knew the light, but disillusioned with their
    old masters, (or after failing to deny a hunger within) they betrayed their masters
    and now serve only themselves, and their own interests. Betrayer monsters (also
    commonly refered to as the fallen) will faithfully serve any master who serves
    themselves - they value independence above all else, and reject masters that
    serve another cause blindly. Many fallen still believe that they are in the right-
    that it is their old masters that have strayed from the true way. These fallen
    have their own definition of 'right' and will serve only as long as you meet
    it.
