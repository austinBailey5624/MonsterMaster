  description: '"I have seen your God''s throne, and it is empty". Dark elementals
    are focused on themselves and improving their lives (some would say self-centered)
    They are fiercely independent and shun others. It is the element of fear, sorrow,
    pain, and depression. Few dark elementals believe that they are evil, instead
    they think everyone else is. It is considered by many to be the representation
    of a lonely abyss that consumes everything around it'
