Attacking them is a sure way to keep them from bonding, instead their attacks must be endured. Mastering a monster is a tricky thing, with many variables at play. You are more likely to master those that match your elemental nature, and those that you are much stronger than.</string>

    <string name="scene117prompt">You may already be one. Yet monsters respect those that have power, be it martial, arcane, or otherwise.

    <string name="scene118prompt">Thus year one of our calendar was reckoned as Erebius began his pilgrimage seeking those who embodied Anu\'s virtues. First he met a pious king, named Ahros, who had served him in his war. Erebius did not elevate him for his righteous authority, but for the prudence and humility with which he judged his fellow man. Thus Ahros knelt before Erebius, and rose again as Ahros, God of Justice, first face of Anu.</string>

    <string name="scene120prompt">Erebius brought his traitorous servant Pythion before Ahros, and asked the God-King to pass judgement. Ahros replied:\"The law of balance decrees that Pythion should have the evil he had done others done to himself in the same measure\".

The source of White magic is the God\'s themselves, and can be granted or taken by them at a whim, while Grey magic uses the innate magic from an individual.

    <string name="scene140choice2">Actually I\'m going to play outside</string><!--132-->
    <string name="scene141prompt">Combat is a violent brutal game, and one that must be won. When there are multiple combatants on each side, organization is the key to victory. Though there are exceptions, combatants typically fall into one of three categories. 1) Tanks whose job is to withstand damage so it does not fall upon weaker party members, 2) Glass cannons that deal incredible damage but are themselves vulnerable, and 3) Healers, buffers, and debuffers that help the party in different ways.</string>

    <string name="scene142prompt">Organization is key- keep the tanks and those that can take damage in the front, while leaving the glass cannons and healers in the back. If you have multiple tanks, or those that can soak damage, put the primary tank in the center of the front, where they will receive the most attention from foes, while leaving weaker tanks to the sides.</string>

    <string name="scene143prompt">True masters of combat will defeat their enemies before they have a chance to strike. This means that typically slow, defensive tanks will contribute very little to this stratedgy. Synergize your slow physical tank with fast Glass cannons, and exploit elemental weaknesses for extra damage.</string>

    <string name="scene144prompt">Almost everything has an elemental nature, and each nature has advantages and disadvantages for each type of enemy. For instance, a water elemental will find their attacks especially effective against fire elementals, as fire will for air, air will for earth, and earth will for water. Moral Elements (Light and Darkness) are offensively strong against each other while being defensively weak against each other.</string>

    <string name="scene145prompt">So if you are in a battle between light and darkness, the surest way to victory is to strike first.

    <string name="scene147prompt">I pray that you will always have that option, as violence begets violence, but life is not always so black and white. The correct way is to kill as rarely as you can, and only when you must. This will keep the gods on your side, and prevent you from being a victim of retribution from the fallen\'s family.</string>
    <string name="scene147choice1">I wouldn\'t want that</string><!--150-->

    <string name="scene162prompt">Common goods can be harvested from slain monsters, though more valuable commodities will be found the more dangerous monster you encounter. Selling these goods immediately is unwise however, as they are worth more in far away lands.

    <string name="scene164prompt">Your mother loved you. She left because she had no other choice. Resentment and hatred are natural, but they do not serve you. Try to forgive her for falling short of your expectations. The priest Michael would tell you to have compassion, and instead have gratitude for what you do have, a father and brother that love you.</string>
    <string name="scene164choice1">Continue</string><!--165-->
    <string name="scene165prompt">He would tell you this is what the Gods want, and maybe he is right, I don\'t know. What I do know is this: Resentment doesn\'t serve you. Don\'t let go for the gods, let go for yourself.</string>

    <string name="scene166prompt">I cannot say. She may yet return from her journeys, but I would not dwell upon it. Instead of wasting away, dreaming of a future that may never come, live in the present moment, and focus on what\'s in front of you. Do not be trapped in a future that may never come.</string>

    <string name="scene174prompt">Yes, monsters require constant care. You can pay others to board and feed them, but its not cheap. The wise way is to first earn some passive income so you can spend it on your monsters. Those that are not cared for may run back into the wild.</string>

    <string name="scene192choice2">Adventure it is!</string><!--191-->
    <string name="scene193prompt">Not so! For the onions need to be plucked from the backs of bulbapups, infant monsters in the forest</string>

    <string name="scene195choice2">Bye!</string><!--187-->
    <string name="scene196prompt">Ahh but the burdens we carry for others are what gives life meaning, and you will find others will then help carry your burdens later. It is good to have this Karma, no?</string>
    <string name="scene196choice1">Karma isn\'t real</string><!--200-->
    <string name="scene196choice2">You\'re right, I\'ll help</string><!--191-->
    <string name="scene197prompt">No, no they will regenrate it again in time. To kill a thing is always a choice, not something done unintentionally.</string>

Kill it before it speaks, as those that hear its voice turn mad. It is said that none can hide from its sight, and the it drinks the light and the hope out of all that oppose it.</string>

    <string name="monster_type_337_description">The wolf has satiated all its hunger for power, all of its hunger for food. It has everything it could want, and yet still is empty. A hollow, empty purple fire embraces it, a physical manifestation of the loneliness pride wrought.</string>

    <string name="monster_type_338_description">The onyx consumes the light around it, giving it a halo of shadow. It crystalizes any energy sent at it and consumes it at will. It bows only to masters that serve themselves, and even then, the master must be powerful enough to dominate it utterly. It\'s made of a thousand onyx crystals, each incredibly valuable, but anything that would seek to take them is a fool- they are cursed and embedded with darkness.</string>

As such, it can cast greater darkness magics and regular magics of every other element. Each of the surrounding elementals is its slave, and serves it utterly. Its very existence is an affront to decency.</string>
